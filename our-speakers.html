                <p>"Move Fast and Build Things: A Non-Technical Guide to AI Agents" is a talk for anyone who's ever needed a single feature locked behind an expensive subscription or found themselves waiting weeks for a simple proof of concept. While AI agents might not quite live up to all the hype, they are genuinely reshaping how quickly we can design and deliver software. In this session, I’ll demonstrate how to take an idea and turn it into a working product within a matter of hours, share a practical process to follow, point out common pitfalls, and discuss the limitations of the technology. Whether you're a technical founder or simply someone with a good idea, this talk will show you how AI agents can help you build things faster and more efficiently.</p>
