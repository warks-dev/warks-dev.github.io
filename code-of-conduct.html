            <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
            <p>WARKS.DEV is committed to providing a safe and welcoming space for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or beliefs. Harassment or discriminatory behaviour in any form is not acceptable within our community.</p>            
            <p>Our Code of Conduct has three key components:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Our Commitment</li>
                <li>Your Responsibilities</li>
                <li>Explanation of Terms and Actions</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Any participant found violating, or suspected of violating, this code of conduct may receive a warning, face sanctions, or be expelled from the community at the discretion of the WARKS.DEV organisers.</p>

            <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>We strive to create a friendly and inclusive environment for all our events.</li>
                <li>We will treat everyone with dignity and respect.</li>
                <li>We will enforce this code of conduct consistently and fairly.</li>
                <li>We will address reports of misconduct promptly and with complete attention.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Your Responsibilities</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Treat everyone with respect and empathy.</li>
                <li>Do not engage in harassment or discriminatory behaviour.</li>
                <li>Avoid using offensive language or imagery.</li>
                <li>Report any inappropriate behaviour to an organiser via email at organisers@warks.dev.</li>
                <li>Familiarise yourself with and adhere to this code of conduct during WARKS.DEV events.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Full Explanation</h2>
            <p>Harassment can include, but is not limited to:</p>            
            <ul>
                <li>Offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, nationality, or beliefs.</li>
                <li>Deliberate intimidation, threats, or stalking.</li>
                <li>Unwelcome photography or recording.</li>
                <li>Disruption of events or talks.</li>
                <li>Inappropriate physical contact.</li>
                <li>Unwanted sexual attention or remarks.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Sexual language or imagery is not suitable for any WARKS.DEV event or communication channel.</p>
            <p>Community members asked to stop any of the above behaviour are expected to comply immediately. If an individual continues with forbidden behaviour, the WARKS.DEV organisers may take appropriate action, including issuing a warning, expelling them from the event or community, and/or reporting them to relevant authorities.</p>
            <p>If you are experiencing harassment, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a WARKS.DEV organiser as soon as you feel comfortable. We take all concerns seriously and will act to ensure a safe and respectful community.</p>
